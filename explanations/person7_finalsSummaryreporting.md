# Person 7 — Final Summary & Reporting

This section summarizes all previous analysis and presents final conclusions.

---

## 1) Cleaned Dataset Preview

We display the first rows of the cleaned dataset to confirm:

- Numeric columns are properly formatted
- No obvious structural issues
- Data types are consistent

This ensures our analysis was performed on clean data.

## 2) Final Conclusions

Based on probability, statistics, grouping, and EDA:

• Rentals are concentrated in a limited number of genres and titles.  
• Customer ratings are generally high, indicating positive satisfaction trends.  
• Some numeric columns contain extreme values that may distort averages.  
• Revenue distribution is uneven across groups and regions.

These findings describe patterns present in the stored data.

## 3) Data Quality Improvements

To improve reliability and analysis quality:

• Standardize category values (avoid inconsistent spelling or capitalization).  
• Enforce constraints in the database (e.g., NOT NULL, valid rating range).  
• Validate numeric ranges (runtime, price).  
• Monitor extreme values to prevent input errors.  
• Maintain strict primary/foreign key relationships.

## Why This Step Matters

Final reporting connects technical analysis with real-world interpretation.

It transforms raw calculations into structured insights and practical recommendations.
