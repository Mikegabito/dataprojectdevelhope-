# General Purpose of This Homework

This homework uses a movie rental database to explore probability concepts through real data.
Instead of working only with abstract formulas, probability is applied to concrete situations such as movie genres, ratings, runtimes, and customer behavior.

Each “Person” represents a different step in how probability is used to understand uncertainty, patterns, and relationships in data.
Together, they form a complete and connected learning path.

## Person 1 – Basic Probability (Foundations)

Person 1 focuses on the most basic idea of probability: counting.

The goal is to understand how often something happens compared to all possible cases.
Examples include:

- how common each movie genre is,
- how likely a movie is to be long,
- how often rentals receive ratings,
- and how customers are distributed by country or gender.

This step defines the sample space and the events.
It answers the fundamental question:
“What does the data look like overall?”

All later probability reasoning depends on this foundation.

## Person 2 – Conditional Probability

Person 2 introduces the idea that probabilities change when we already know something.

Instead of asking:
“What is the probability of an event?”

It asks:
“What is the probability of an event, given that another event has already occurred?”

For example:

- How likely is a genre if the movie is long?
- How likely is a high rating if the movie belongs to a certain genre?

Even when not fully implemented in code, this Person is essential conceptually because it shows that probability depends on context and information, not just raw counts.

## Person 3 – Independent vs Dependent Events

Person 3 explores whether two events influence each other.

Some events are independent:

knowing one does not change the probability of the other.

Other events are dependent:

knowing one changes what we expect about the other.

This Person compares what actually happens in the data with what would happen if events were independent.
It helps identify real relationships and avoid incorrect assumptions.

## Person 4 – Discrete Random Variables

Person 4 shifts from individual events to random variables.

Here, values such as movie ratings or the number of movies rented by a customer are treated as quantities that vary randomly.
Instead of focusing on one outcome, the emphasis is on:

- typical values (expected value),
- and how much results vary (variance).

This Person explains how probability summarizes complex data into meaningful numerical descriptions.

## Person 5 – Sampling and Monte Carlo Simulation

Person 5 focuses on approximation and randomness.

Instead of calculating probabilities exactly, this Person uses repeated random sampling to estimate them.
By running many simulations, probability patterns emerge from observed behavior.

This step explains why small samples can produce unstable results and why larger numbers of repetitions lead to more reliable estimates.
It introduces the idea that probability is closely tied to repetition and variability.

## Person 6 – Bayes’ Theorem

Person 6 brings all previous ideas together.

It shows how probabilities can be updated when new information becomes available.
Instead of looking only at what is common overall, this Person asks:
“How likely is something, given what we already know?”

Bayes’ Theorem provides a structured way to combine prior knowledge with new evidence.
This reflects real-world reasoning, where decisions evolve as more information is learned.

## How All Persons Are Connected

All Persons form a single logical progression:

- Person 1 describes the data.
- Person 2 adds context through conditions.
- Person 3 studies relationships.
- Person 4 models uncertainty numerically.
- Person 5 explains approximation through repetition.
- Person 6 updates beliefs using evidence.

Together, they show that probability is not just about formulas, but about structured thinking with real data and uncertainty.
