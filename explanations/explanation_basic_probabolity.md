# Person 1 – Basic Probability

This part of the project focuses on understanding probability using real data from the movie rental system.

The program connects to the database and reads information about movies, rentals, and customers. Instead of guessing probabilities, it calculates them by counting how often certain events happen and comparing them to the total number of records.

First, it looks at movies and calculates the probability of each genre. This tells us how common each genre is compared to all movies in the database.

Then, it analyzes movie release years. For example, it shows the percentage of movies released after 2000, 2010, and 2020. This helps understand how modern the movie catalog is.

Next, the program checks movie length. It calculates how many movies are longer than 90, 120, or 150 minutes and expresses the result as a percentage.

The program also analyzes rentals. It calculates the probability that a rental has a rating and shows how ratings from 1 to 5 are distributed among rated rentals.

Finally, it studies customers. It calculates the probability of customers coming from different countries and the distribution of customer gender.

All results are shown as percentages to make them easier to understand. The probabilities are based entirely on real data and simple counting, which makes the results intuitive and reliable.
