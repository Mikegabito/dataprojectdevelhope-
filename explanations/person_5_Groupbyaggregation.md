# Person 5 — GroupBy & Aggregation

In this section, we organize the data into groups and calculate summary statistics for each group.

Grouping means:
We divide the dataset into categories (like genre or country) and analyze each category separately.

Aggregation means:
We calculate summary values such as:

- Count → how many records
- Mean → average
- Sum → total amount

---

## 1) Group by Genre

We group movies by genre and calculate:

- Total rentals
- Average movie rating
- Total revenue generated

This shows which genres are most popular and most profitable.

---

## 2) Group by Country

We group by customer country and calculate:

- Total rentals
- Average customer rating
- Total revenue

This helps understand which countries are most active and how they rate movies.

---

## 3) Group by Gender

We group by gender and calculate:

- Total rentals
- Average rating given
- Total revenue generated

This provides insight into behavior differences across gender categories.

## Why GroupBy is Important

Grouping transforms raw data into structured insights.

Instead of looking at thousands of rows, we see:

- Which categories perform best
- Where revenue comes from
- How ratings differ by group

This is a core tool in real-world data analysis.
