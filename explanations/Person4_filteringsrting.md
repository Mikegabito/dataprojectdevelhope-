# Person 4 — Filtering & Sorting

In this section, we focus on selecting specific data and organizing it clearly.

Filtering means:
We only keep rows that satisfy certain conditions.

Sorting means:
We organize the results by one or more columns in ascending or descending order.

## 1) Highly Rated Drama Movies (After 2010)

We filter:

- Genre = Drama
- Average rating ≥ 4
- Released after 2010

Then we sort by:

- Highest rating first
- Newest movies first

This helps identify the best modern Drama movies.

## Why Filtering & Sorting Matters

Filtering helps answer targeted questions.
Sorting helps organize results so we can quickly see the most important entries.
