# Person 3 — Descriptive Statistics

This section summarizes the numerical information inside the movie rental database.

Instead of asking “how likely?”, here we ask:

- What is the average?
- What is typical?
- How spread out are the values?

## 1) describe()

The function describe() gives a quick statistical summary:

- count → how many values exist
- mean → average
- std → standard deviation (how spread out values are)
- min → smallest value
- 25%, 50%, 75% → percentiles
- max → largest value

It gives a global overview of the data.

## 2) Manual Calculations

We manually compute:

Mean  
The average value.

Median  
The middle value when numbers are ordered.

Mode  
The most frequent value.

This shows we understand the math behind the built-in tools.

## 3) Min, Max, Standard Deviation

Min  
The smallest value in the column.

Max  
The largest value.

Standard Deviation  
How much the values vary around the average.

- Small standard deviation → values are similar.
- Large standard deviation → values are more spread out.

## Why This Matters

Descriptive statistics help us understand:

- Typical movie runtime
- Typical release year
- Average rental price
- How ratings are distributed
- Whether data is stable or highly variable

This section describes the data — it does not predict anything.
