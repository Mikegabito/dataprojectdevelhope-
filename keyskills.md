# Key Skills Demonstrated  

SQL & Python Data Analysis Project

---

This document highlights the core technical and analytical skills demonstrated through the development of this project.  
Each skill is supported by concrete implementation within the repository.

---

## SQL & Relational Data Analysis

- Writing complex SQL queries using:
  - SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
  - JOINs across multiple tables
  - Aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG)
- Designing queries that answer analytical questions rather than just retrieving data
- Understanding relational data models and foreign-key relationships
- Translating business questions into structured SQL logic

---

## Python for Data Analysis & Automation

- Building a reusable, menu-driven CLI application in Python
- Executing SQL queries programmatically using a single generic query runner
- Managing database connections and cursors safely
- Implementing structured error handling to prevent application crashes
- Separating computation logic from presentation and formatting logic

---

## NumPy & Vectorized Computation

- Using NumPy arrays as the primary data structure for analysis
- Applying boolean masks to define events and subsets
- Computing probabilities without explicit loops
- Manually calculating:
  - Conditional probabilities
  - Probability Mass Functions (PMF)
  - Expected value
  - Variance and standard deviation
- Leveraging vectorization for performance and clarity

---

## Probability & Statistical Reasoning

- Understanding and applying:
  - Basic probability concepts
  - Conditional probability
  - Independent vs dependent events
  - Discrete random variables
  - Bayes’ Theorem
- Correctly selecting denominators in conditional probability
- Identifying and avoiding common statistical pitfalls
- Interpreting numerical results in analytical, non-technical language

---

## Monte Carlo Simulation

- Designing Monte Carlo experiments to approximate probabilities
- Running simulations with large sample sizes
- Comparing empirical results with theoretical expectations
- Understanding randomness, convergence, and estimation error

---

## Data Quality & Robustness

- Handling missing values explicitly (NULL / NaN)
- Preventing division-by-zero and undefined probabilities
- Validating assumptions before performing calculations
- Ensuring scripts fail gracefully when data is insufficient

---

## Software Design & Project Organization

- Structuring a project with clear separation of concerns:
  - SQL logic
  - Python execution layer
  - Statistical analysis
  - Documentation
- Writing modular, reusable, and readable code
- Following naming conventions and consistent file organization
- Maintaining a clean Git history and repository structure

---

## Analytical Communication

- Presenting results in human-readable formats (percentages, rounded values)
- Explaining statistical outcomes clearly and accurately
- Writing professional documentation using Markdown
- Connecting technical results to analytical insights

---

## Relevance for a Data Analyst Role

This project demonstrates readiness for real-world data analyst responsibilities by combining:

- SQL for data extraction
- Python for automation and analysis
- NumPy for efficient computation
- Statistical reasoning for correct interpretation
- Clear communication of results

The focus is not only on producing outputs, but on ensuring that results are correct, explainable, and meaningful.

## Summary

This repository reflects a complete analytical workflow, from raw data stored in a relational database to statistically sound insights communicated clearly.  
It demonstrates both technical competence and analytical maturity expected from a Data Analyst.
